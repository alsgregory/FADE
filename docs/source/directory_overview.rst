Directory Overview
=================

The directories of FADE are set-up as below:

- ``/``: The FADE base directory contents include a Makefile (used to run the automated tests and
         check for linting errors), a LICENSE file and a README.

- ``/fade``: The Python and C source code for the functionality offered by this package.

- ``/tutorials``: A series of user tutorials to demonstrate how to implement the basic functionality
                  offered by this package. These inspire the documentation.

- ``/examples``: A number of data-assimilation problems and examples that FADE is used to implement,
                 such as a filter used on a toy-problem, and code to generate output showing the posterior convergence
                 of the techniques used in FADE.

- ``/docs``: The source code used for the generation of the documentation.

- ``/tests``: A series of automated tests.
