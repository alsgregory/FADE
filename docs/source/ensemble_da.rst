Ensemble-Based Data Assimilation
================================

Overview
--------

The ensemble data assimilation problem is defined in this section. Consider
a function :math:`f \in V`, where :math:`V` is a function space, that either
has a random initial condition, :math:`f \sim \eta_{0}` at time 0, or a
random component, such as a stochastic forcing term. An ensemble of these
Given functions, :math:`f^i \in V`, where :math:`V` is a function space,
i = 1,...,N
